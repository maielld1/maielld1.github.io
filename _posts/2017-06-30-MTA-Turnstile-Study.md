title: MTA Turnstile Study - Week 1 at Metis
---

For the first project of the Metis bootcamp, we were tasked with drawing insights from messy MTA subway turnstile data in NYC.

### The problem

A women-in-tech nonprofit (WTWY) wants to improve their outreach strategy. They have an annual gala coming up, and they want to raise awareness and collect signatures from folks who might attend the gala or contribute to their organization by placing street teams at subway entrances.

### The Approach

With the goal of raising awareness and donations made clear, we need to think about who to target. An easy strategy is to target subway stations with high volume of commuters. We can simply clean and munge the data and find out which stations have a lot of people exiting and entering their turnstiles (most likely near Grand Central, Times SQ, etc.).

Our team decided that this approach would not be enough as it ignores the goal of raising donations. To address this, we incorporated data on the income of NYC residents and property values.
