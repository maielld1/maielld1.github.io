**Currently in the top 8% of the public leaderboard**

I had my eye on this competition for a couple months and, after my first few weeks of some intensive learning at Metis bootcamp, I felt like I was ready to officially take it on.

For anyone who hasn't head of Instacart:

"Whether you shop from meticulously planned grocery lists or let whimsy guide your grazing, our unique food rituals define who we are. Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, aims to make it easy to fill your refrigerator and pantry with your personal favorites and staples when you need them. After selecting products through the Instacart app, personal shoppers review your order and do the in-store shopping and delivery for you."

As someone who dreads grocery shopping, it sounds like I am their target customer.

Well, I would be if I knew how to make any food other than Digiorno pizza or Eggo waffles...I should probably learn how to cook...

But I digress

Instacart's Data Science team currently uses transactional data to develop models that predict which products a user will buy again, try for the first time, or add to their cart next during a session. These models have a huge impact on optimizing the user experience as they can recommend products based on a user's past behavior.

### The Competition

Kaggle opened this competition a few months ago to see who could best use Instacart's open sourced data to predict what products people will repurchase in their next order. The data includes a sample of 3 Million Orders from over 200,000 customers. Each customer has made anywhere from 4 to 100 orders. Each order includes information of the hour of day, day of week, days between previous orders, etc.
