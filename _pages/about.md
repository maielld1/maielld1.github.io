My strengths are in data anaysis/engineering, machine learning, and process automation. I like to use math and technology to make decision-making easier.

Currently:
  - Manager, Revenue & Strategy at FanDuel

Previously:
  - Software Developer at UPS
  - Systems Engineer at Lockheed Martin
  - Electrical Engineering at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ)

I like to use Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.), SQL, and AWS for modeling and analysis, but I also have experience with Java and R.
