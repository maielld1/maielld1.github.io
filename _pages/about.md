My strengths are in Machine Learning and Software Development. I like to use math and technology to make decision-making easier.

Previously:
  - Software Developer at UPS
  - Systems Engineer at Lockheed Martin
  - Electrical Engineering at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ)

I like to use Python (Pandas, NumPy, etc.) and SQL for modeling and analysis, but I also have experience with Java and R.
