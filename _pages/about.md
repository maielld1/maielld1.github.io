My strengths are in Data Analytics and Software Development. I aim to use my skill set to help people make data-driven decisions based on the proven facts that are available.

I previously worked as a Software Developer at UPS, I help manage a web application and massive database to automate the accounting process for the collections department. I also developed a model of their employee engagement survey using natural language processing to perform sentiment analysis on employee responses.

Prior to working, I received my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from The College of New Jersey.

I prefer to use Python (Pandas, NumPy, etc.) and SQL for modeling and analysis, but I also have experience with R and Java.
